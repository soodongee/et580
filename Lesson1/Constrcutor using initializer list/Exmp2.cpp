//The Ex1 class has a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor initializes the private member x with the given value and prints a message.

//The Ex2 class has a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. However, the parameterized constructor now uses an initializer list to directly initialize members and the ex1 object.

//In the main function, an Ex2 object ex2_init is created using the parameterized constructor with arguments 2 and 3.

//When you run the program, the following output is generated:
//Ex1 Constructor with Parameters  // This is the parameterized construction of ex1 within Ex2
//Ex2 Constructor with Parameters  // This is the parameterized construction of Ex2

//
//With the use of an initializer list, the Ex1 object ex1 within the Ex2 class is directly constructed
//with the parameterized constructor, avoiding the unnecessary default construction and later assignment
//steps. This results in more efficient and direct member initialization.

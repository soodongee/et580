//In this code:

//The Ex1 class has a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor initializes the private member x with the given value and prints a message.

//The Ex2 class has a default constructor and a parameterized constructor. The parameterized constructor takes two arguments, x and d. It creates an Ex1 object using its parameterized constructor, initializing ex1 with the given value of x. Then, it assigns values to x and d using the this pointer. Finally, it prints a message.

//In the main function, an Ex2 object ex2 is created using the parameterized constructor with arguments 2 and 3.


//When you run the program, the following output is generated:
//Ex1 Default Constructor   // This is the default construction of ex1 within Ex2
//Ex1 Constructor with Parameters  // This is the parameterized construction of ex1 within Ex2
//Ex2 Constructor with Parameters  // This is the parameterized construction of Ex2

//
//In this case, without an initializer list, the Ex1 object ex1 within the Ex2 class is first
//default-constructed and then assigned a value using the parameterized constructor.
//This leads to an unnecessary extra construction and assignment step. Using an initializer list
//in the constructor of Ex2 could avoid this extra work and provide a more efficient way to
//initialize the member ex1.
